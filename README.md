My teammate and I have created a modern vehicle UI that heavily incorporates the technology available to us today. Not only does our UI better you as a driver, it combines the different IoT devices around us to make a better, more caring, and less distracted vehicle. Our infotainment consists of the following screens:

1) The main screen showing vehicle speed, RPM, outside temperature, fuel level, and a 3D vehicle model. Standard Stuff.

2) The second screen is the main music screen with the album art subtly displayed in the background.

3) The weather screen comes next, with the background showing specific weather conditions such as snow and rain. There's also an album art Coverflow that lets you pick music

4) The accident screen. In case you get an accident, the vehicle shows the damaged spot and subsequently dials 911 for you, unless you specifically stop it.

5) HeartRate sensing. The vehicle senses heart rate data and tells you in case its abnormally high or you are stressed, advising you to pull over and rest.

6) Distracted Driving. A camera placed above the steering wheel calculates how much time you spend looking away from the road. This advises you of your driving habits with the vehicle coaching you to drive less distracted.  

Equipment used: 

Android Phone to act as server
Android Tablet to act as infotainment display
Router for connection
Arduino Uno to get accurate heart rate readings
Raspberry Pi (w/camera) to track driver facial direction and communicate heart rate readings to the central server
Appropriate Sensors
